### NOTE
Almost nothing is documented or commented, because im too lazy to do so.

### Quickstart
```shell
mv -r ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/old-nvim-config # save your previous neovim config
git clone https://github.com/netfri25/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

After that, opening neovim will automatically install packer and sync all the plugins, but it will result in a long error which you can safely ignore and it will say that it failed to install treesitter, but relaunching neovim will cause all errors to vanish.
